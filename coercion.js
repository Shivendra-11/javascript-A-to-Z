// In JavaScript, coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another, such as from a string to a number or vice versa. Coercion can happen implicitly (automatically by JavaScript) or explicitly (manually by the developer). There are two main types of coercion: type coercion and type conversion.


// Implicit Coercion
// Implicit coercion happens automatically when JavaScript expects a certain type of value and tries to convert the provided value to the expected type. This can lead to unexpected results if not understood properly.


// Explicit Coercion
// Explicit coercion happens when you manually convert a value from one type to another using JavaScript built-in functions or methods.
